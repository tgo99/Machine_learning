# Basic Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of **basic machine learning projects**, all written from scratch as part of my personal learning journey. These projects are inspired by exercises from the *Machine Learning with Python* course (Coursera, IBM), but were completely rewritten and expanded to reflect my own understanding and implementation.

Each project includes:
- A fully commented Jupyter Notebook
- A real or simulated dataset
- Model training, evaluation, and visualizations
- A brief explanation of the methodology used

## üìÅ Projects Included

- **01 - Linear Regression**
  - Predictive modeling using a single feature
  - Performance evaluated with mean squared error and visual plots

- **02 - Multiple Linear Regression**
  - Predictive modeling with multiple input features
  - Includes feature selection and comparison

- **03 - Decision Tree**
  - Classification using a tree-based model
  - Includes tree visualization and performance metrics

- **04 - Logistic Regression**
  - Binary classification task
  - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

- **05 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - Classification with linear and non-linear kernels
  - Includes kernel selection and hyperparameter tuning

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## üéØ Project Goals
The goals of this repository are to:
- Practice implementing foundational machine learning models from scratch
- Build clean, well-documented, and reproducible code
- Start developing a portfolio of applied data science and machine learning projects

All code in this repository was rewritten from scratch based on the concepts and assignments from the Machine Learning with Python course (Coursera, IBM), with the goal of reinforcing my understanding and building practical coding skills.
