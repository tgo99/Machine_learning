# Basic Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of **basic machine learning projects**, all written from scratch as part of my personal learning journey. These projects are based on exercises from the *Machine Learning with Python* course (Coursera, IBM), but were fully rewritten and expanded to reflect my own understanding and implementation.

Each project includes:
- A fully commented Jupyter Notebook
- A real or simulated dataset
- Model training, evaluation, and visualizations
- A brief explanation of the methodology used

## üìÅ Projects Included

- **01 - Linear Regression**
  - Predictive modeling using a single feature
  - Performance evaluated using mean squared error and visual plots

- **02 - Multiple Linear Regression**
  - Predictive modeling with multiple input features
  - Includes feature selection and performance comparison

- **03 - Logistic Regression**
  - Binary classification problem
  - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

- **04 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - Classification with both linear and non-linear kernels
  - Includes parameter tuning and performance analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## üéØ Project Goals
The aim of this repository is to:
- Practice implementing foundational machine learning models
- Develop clean, readable, and reproducible code
- Build a small but meaningful portfolio of applied data science projects

All code was written independently without copying from course solutions, to reinforce genuine understanding and application of the concepts.
