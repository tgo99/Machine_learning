# Basic Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of **basic machine learning projects**, all written from scratch as part of my personal learning journey. These projects are inspired by exercises from the *Machine Learning with Python* course (Coursera, IBM), but were completely rewritten and expanded to reflect my own understanding and implementation.

Each project includes:
- A fully commented Jupyter Notebook
- A real or simulated dataset
- Model training, evaluation, and visualizations
- A brief explanation of the methodology used

## üìÅ Projects Included

- **01 - Linear Regression**
  - Predictive modeling using a single feature
  - Performance evaluated with mean squared error and visual plots

- **02 - Multiple Linear Regression**
  - Predictive modeling with multiple input features
  - Includes feature selection and comparison

- **03 - Decision Tree**
  - Classification using a tree-based model
  - Includes tree visualization and performance metrics

- **04 - Logistic Regression**
  - Binary classification task
  - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

- **05 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - Classification with linear and non-linear kernels
  - Includes kernel selection and hyperparameter tuning

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## üéØ Project Goals
The goals of this repository are to:
- Practice implementing foundational machine learning models from scratch
- Build clean, well-documented, and reproducible code
- Start developing a portfolio of applied data science and machine learning projects

All code was written independently, without reusing solutions from the course, to demonstrate real understanding and hands-on capability.
